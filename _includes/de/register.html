					Registration is limited to 160 attendees on a first come, first serve basis. Registration fee
					is EUR 699,- plus 19% VAT, and covers all three conference days. It also includes food and
					beverages throughout the conference days, and the evening event including food and drinks.
				</p>
				<p>
					It does not include accomodation. We have reserved a hotel contingent for you (100 rooms in the 
					congress hotel right next to the venue). You can also search for accommodation in Hannover yourself. 
					Make sure it is located close to a tram station.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you register, we send an invoice to the email address you specify, with the billing address you 
					specified. You then have 30 days to pay the invoice, provided there are still seats available. After 30 days, 
					your registration request is automatically cancelled. Once the invoice is paid, you receive a registration 
					confirmation. If you decide to not pay the invoice in time, your registration is automatically cancelled. 
					If you pay the invoice after all seats were already taken, we reimburse your payment. If you need changes 
					to your invoice before you paid (address change etc), register again with the correct details. If you need 
					changes after you registered (i.e. attendee changes),  or if you have other questions, don't hesitate to
